A Website for Displaying Historical Events in Their Temporal Context

This is a website that displays historical events within their historical temporal context. It is developed using vibe programming, with currently over 95% of the code generated by AI. The project is under continuous iteration, and we welcome issue submissions, bug fixes, and contributions.

Features Under Development:

1. Internationalization: Support for multiple languages
2. Historical Event Data Extraction: Pulling historical event data from Wikipedia
3. User Interface Optimization: 
   • Linking map zoom levels with event importance rankings
   • Mobile client adaptation
   • Other UI/UX improvements
4. Known Issues:
   • Slider length doesn't match Thumb movement
   • Markers on map display with offset issues
   • Additional bugs to be identified and resolved

We appreciate any contributions to help improve this project!
